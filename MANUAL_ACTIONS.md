## 3. Graduate Research Assistant Description Update

Replace/enhance your current description with:

**Current Role** (Jun 2025 - Present)

PhD Candidate researching Explainable AI (XAI) methods for trustworthy, auditable AI systems.

Research Focus:
• Transformer interpretability: logic-gated modules, attention probes, mechanistic analysis
• Faithful explanations: attribution methods, counterfactual probes, stability testing
• Adversarial robustness: perturbation analysis, model brittleness, edge cases
• Applications: Biometrics, LLMs, vision models, safety-critical systems

Dissertation: Developing falsifiable attribution methods that can be empirically validated and audited.

Proposal: January 2026 | Defense: November 2026

Publication: IEEE T-BIOM submission - Beta regression framework for bounded biometric metrics

## 4. Weekly Content Ideas (First 4 Posts)

### Post 1: Research Introduction
```
Opening the Black Box: My PhD Journey

I'm 6 months into my PhD at Clarkson University, focused on one question:

How do we know if an AI explanation is actually faithful to what the model is doing?

Most XAI methods give us *something* - saliency maps, attention weights, feature importance. But are these explanations reliable? Can we trust them?

My research develops methods to empirically test explanation faithfulness through:
- Adversarial probing
- Counterfactual analysis
- Stability testing across perturbations

The goal: Make explainability an engineering discipline with measurable standards.

Proposal: January 2026 | Defense: November 2026

```

### Post 2: Educational Content
```
If you're learning ML in 2025, here's the path that actually works:

1. Python fundamentals (not just syntax - data structures, flow control)
2. Math foundations (linear algebra + calculus + probability)
3. Data preprocessing (80% of real ML work)
4. Classical algorithms first (regression, trees, SVM)
5. THEN deep learning

I co-created a free curriculum that follows this exact path:
100 Days of Machine Learning - 35 lessons from basics to ensemble methods

No paywalls. No fluff. Just structured learning with Colab notebooks.

### Post 3: Technical Insight
```
Attention weights ≠ explanation.

One of the biggest misconceptions in XAI:

"The model attended to these tokens, so that's why it made this prediction."

Problems:
1. Attention is often distributed, not focused
2. Attention patterns don't always correlate with model behavior
3. You can get identical outputs with different attention patterns

What works better:
- Gradient-based attribution (with sanity checks)
- Counterfactual probes (what changes the output?)
- Mechanistic interpretability (circuit analysis)

The key insight: Always test if your explanation is *faithful* to what the model actually does.

#ExplainableAI #NLP #Transformers #MachineLearning
```

### Post 4: Milestone/Progress
```
PhD Progress Update: Month 6

✓ Completed: Literature review on faithful explanations
✓ Completed: Beta regression framework (IEEE T-BIOM submission)
✓ In progress: Experimental validation framework

Next: Adversarial probing experiments on transformer attention

6 months in. Proposal: January 2026. Defense: November 2026.

The hardest part so far? Narrowing scope. XAI is vast - staying focused on falsifiable methods.

What's helped: Weekly writing habit. Even 500 words of rough notes compounds over time.

Any other PhD candidates in the XAI/trustworthy AI space? Would love to connect.
