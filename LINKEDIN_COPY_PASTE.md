Opening the Black Box: My PhD Journey

I'm researching one fundamental question:

How do we know if an AI explanation is actually faithful to what the model is doing?

Most XAI methods give us something—saliency maps, attention weights, feature importance. But are these explanations reliable? Can we trust them?

My research develops methods to empirically test explanation faithfulness through:
→ Adversarial probing
→ Counterfactual analysis
→ Stability testing across perturbations

The goal: Make explainability an engineering discipline with measurable standards.

Proposal: January 2026 | Defense: November 2026

What challenges have you encountered with AI explainability? I'd love to hear your experiences.

## 10. SECOND POST (Educational - save for later)

```
If you're learning ML in 2025, here's the path that actually works:

1️⃣ Python fundamentals (not just syntax—data structures, flow control)
2️⃣ Math foundations (linear algebra + calculus + probability)
3️⃣ Data preprocessing (this is 80% of real ML work)
4️⃣ Classical algorithms first (regression, trees, SVM)
5️⃣ THEN deep learning

I co-created a free curriculum that follows this exact progression:

100 Days of Machine Learning
→ 35 structured lessons
→ Python basics to ensemble methods
→ Interactive Jupyter notebooks
→ Google Colab integration (no setup required)

No paywalls. No fluff. Just structured learning.

## 11. THIRD POST (Technical insight - save for later)

```
Attention weights ≠ explanation.

One of the biggest misconceptions in XAI:

"The model attended to these tokens, so that's why it made this prediction."

Three problems with this:

1. Attention is often distributed, not focused
2. Attention patterns don't always correlate with model behavior
3. You can get identical outputs with completely different attention patterns

What works better for understanding transformers:

→ Gradient-based attribution (with sanity checks)
→ Counterfactual probes (what changes the output?)
→ Mechanistic interpretability (circuit analysis)
→ Ablation studies (what breaks when removed?)

The key insight: Always test if your explanation is *faithful* to what the model actually does.

What methods do you use for understanding model decisions?
